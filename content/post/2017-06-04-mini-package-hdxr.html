<h3>Mini package - Mini post</h3>
<p>I realised that when I wrote this <a href="https://callumgwtaylor.github.io/blog/2017/06/04/getting-data-from-humanitarian-data-exchange-in-a-reproducible-r-pipeline/">post</a>, I should do something more sensible to share the code then put the text up in a blog. Writing a package seemed overkill though, and something you only do for ‘real code’.</p>
<p>But curiousity got the better of me, and after reading the go-to <a href="https://hilaryparker.com/2014/04/29/writing-an-r-package-from-scratch/">post</a> for package writing, I thought I might as well try.</p>
<p>So here we are: <a href="https://github.com/callumgwtaylor/hdxr">hdxr</a></p>
<p>It has the functions I mentioned before in the above post</p>
<p><code>hdx_connect()</code> <code>hdx_list()</code> <code>hdx_package_search()</code> <code>hdx_resource_list()</code></p>
<p>How to use them is explained in the github repo and blog post above. There has been no testing whatsoever and I bet they wont work first try for you. If you want to let me know how to improve them or how to use ckanr better then I can be contacted on github or twitter.</p>
